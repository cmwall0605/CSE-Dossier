# Preface
Hello! Welcome to my menagerie of knowledge on the topic of computer science! As a fair warning, I must state that this shouldn't be taken as a discrete tutorial on how to become a computer scientist. Much of my knowledge on topics is incomplete and much of the grouping of information is based on my biased opinion of how computer science should be learned. So then what is the purpose of this if not to be a meaningful tutorial? I suppose the goal of this is two-fold. The first is a personal reason of re-teaching myself much of what I learned in classes at my time at UCSD. The second reason is because I feel this would be a good source of knowledge for those who are already adept at computer science but need a warm-up on a certain topic. Regardless, I hope this document serves you a purpose and I hope you enjoy!
